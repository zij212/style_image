[Kensuke Koike](https://www.kensukekoike.com/) is one of my favorite contemporary visual artist. He is famous for breaking photos apart and reassembling them in interesting ways. This repo is inspired by his series [Today's curiosity](https://www.kensukekoike.com/project/todays-curiosity/todays_curiosity2/). You can watch his process of downsampling a portrait of a whippet into 4 tiny portraits in [this youtube video](https://youtu.be/f1fXCRtSUWU)

Below are the styles implemented in this repo.
